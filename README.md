### Drivers

**Hello**

The obligatory "Hello World" driver. 

**PriorityBooster**

A kernel driver with a user-space client that allows one to set the thread priority of a target thread to an arbitrary value, regardless of the priority class of the thread's containing process. 

**Sysmon**

A kernel driver with a user-space client that allows one to monitor process events (creation, deletion) using the power of driver process callbacks.
